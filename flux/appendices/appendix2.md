Most Flux commands and their options are described in their respective man pages, which can be accessed via the `man` command or via `flux help`. For example, `man flux-run` or `flux help run` will describe the options for the `flux run` command.

The primary source for more general Flux documentation is the Flux [readthedocs](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) page. There, you will find documentation on everything from [getting started](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#) with Flux to [batch jobs](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jobs/batch.html) to [administering Flux on clusters](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/admin-guide.html). There are also a number of [usage examples](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-workflow-examples/en/latest/index.html), descriptions of the [commands](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/index.html) and python bindings](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/python/index.html), and [API and other specifications](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/index.html).

Finally, the Flux developers are very active in the HPC community and have made slides from various tutorials that they have given available on [GitHub](https://github.com/flux-framework/Tutorials).
