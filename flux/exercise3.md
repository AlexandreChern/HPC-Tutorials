## Exercise 3: Batch jobs
1. Ensure that you have a flux instance running in an allocation and determine the number of cores available to you in that allocation.
2. Write a batch script that will run the `mpi_hellosleep` application from [Exercise 2.2](exercise2) with four tasks. Ensure that the script logs when it starts and ends and that it is self documenting.
### Notes / Solutions
1. See [Exercise 1](exercise1).
2. See 'Making your job script submission self documenting' in [Section 3](section3).
