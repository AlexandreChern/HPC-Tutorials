MPI_File_delete(3)                   MPI-2                  MPI_File_delete(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_delete -  Deletes a file

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_delete(char *filename, MPI_Info info)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       filename
              - name of file to delete (string)
       info   - info object (handle)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.

LOCATION
       delete.c
