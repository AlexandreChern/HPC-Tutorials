MPI_Register_datarep(3)              MPI-2             MPI_Register_datarep(3)



NAME
       MPI_Register_datarep  -  Register functions for user-defined data  rep-
       resentations

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_Register_datarep(char *name,
                              MPI_Datarep_conversion_function *read_conv_fn,
                              MPI_Datarep_conversion_function *write_conv_fn,
                              MPI_Datarep_extent_function *extent_fn,
                              void *state)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       name   - data representation name (string)
       read_conv_fn
              - function invoked to convert from file representation to native
              representation (function)
       write_conv_fn
              - function invoked to convert from native representation to file
              representation (function)
       extent_fn
              - function invoked to get the exted of a datatype as represented
              in the file (function)
       extra_state
              -  pointer  to  extra  state that is passed to each of the three
              functions


NOTES
       This function allows the user to provide routines to convert data  from
       an  external  representation, used within a file, and the native repre-
       sentation, used within the CPU.  There is one predefined data represen-
       tation,  external32 .  Please consult the MPI-2 standard for details on
       this function.


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
