MPI_File_write_shared(3)             MPI-2            MPI_File_write_shared(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_write_shared -  Write using shared file pointer

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_write_shared(MPI_File mpi_fh, void *buf, int count,
                                 MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Status *status)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       fh     - file handle (handle)
       buf    - initial address of buffer (choice)
       count  - number of elements in buffer (nonnegative integer)
       datatype
              - datatype of each buffer element (handle)


OUTPUT PARAMETERS
       status - status object (Status)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
