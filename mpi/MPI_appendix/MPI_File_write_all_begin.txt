MPI_File_write_all_begin(3)          MPI-2         MPI_File_write_all_begin(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_write_all_begin  -  Begin a split collective write using indi-
       vidual file pointer

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_write_all_begin(MPI_File mpi_fh, void *buf, int count,
                                  MPI_Datatype datatype)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       fh     - file handle (handle)
       buf    - initial address of buffer (choice)
       count  - number of elements in buffer (nonnegative integer)
       datatype
              - datatype of each buffer element (handle)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
