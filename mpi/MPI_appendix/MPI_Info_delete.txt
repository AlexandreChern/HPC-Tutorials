MPI_Info_delete(3)                   MPI-2                  MPI_Info_delete(3)



NAME
       MPI_Info_delete -  Deletes a (key,value) pair from info

SYNOPSIS
       #include "mpi.h"
       int MPI_Info_delete(MPI_Info info, char *key)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       info   - info object (handle)
       key    - key (string)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
