MPI_File_seek(3)                     MPI-2                    MPI_File_seek(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_seek -  Updates the individual file pointer

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_seek(MPI_File mpi_fh, MPI_Offset offset, int whence)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       fh     - file handle (handle)
       offset - file offset (integer)
       whence - update mode (state)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
