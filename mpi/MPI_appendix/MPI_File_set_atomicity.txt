MPI_File_set_atomicity(3)            MPI-2           MPI_File_set_atomicity(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_set_atomicity -  Sets the atomicity mode

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_set_atomicity(MPI_File mpi_fh, int flag)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       fh     - file handle (handle)
       flag   - true to set atomic mode, false to set nonatomic mode (logical)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK )  have
       an  additional  argument ierr at the end of the argument list.  ierr is
       an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the  routine
       in  C.   In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
