MPI_File_open(3)                     MPI-2                    MPI_File_open(3)



NAME
       MPI_File_open -  Opens a file

SYNOPSIS
       int MPI_File_open(MPI_Comm comm, char *filename, int amode,
                         MPI_Info info, MPI_File *fh)

INPUT PARAMETERS
       comm   - communicator (handle)
       filename
              - name of file to open (string)
       amode  - file access mode (integer)
       info   - info object (handle)


OUTPUT PARAMETERS
       fh     - file handle (handle)


NOTES FOR FORTRAN
       All  MPI routines in Fortran (except for MPI_WTIME and MPI_WTICK ) have
       an additional argument ierr at the end of the argument list.   ierr  is
       an  integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
       in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are  invoked  with
       the call statement.

       All MPI objects (e.g., MPI_Datatype , MPI_Comm ) are of type INTEGER in
       Fortran.
