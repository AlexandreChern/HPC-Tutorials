## Monitoring and Debugging Pthreads

- Debuggers vary in their ability to handle Pthreads. The TotalView debugger is LC's recommended debugger for parallel programs. It is well suited for both monitoring and debugging threaded programs.
- An example screenshot from a TotalView session using a threaded code is shown below.
    1. Stack Trace Pane: Displays the call stack of routines that the selected thread is executing.
    2. Status Bars: Show status information for the selected thread and its associated process.
    3. Stack Frame Pane: Shows a selected thread's stack variables, registers, etc.
    4. Source Pane: Shows the source code for the selected thread.
    5. Root Window showing all threads
    6. Threads Pane: Shows threads associated with the selected process

- See the [TotalView Debugger tutorial](https://hpc.llnl.gov/training/tutorials/totalview) for details.
- The Linux ps command provides several flags for viewing thread information. Some examples are shown below. See the man page for details.

LC's Linux clusters also provide the top command to monitor processes on a node. If used with the -H flag, the threads contained within a process will be visible. An example of the top -H command is shown below. The parent process is PID 18010 which spawned three threads, shown as PIDs 18012, 18013 and 18014.

## Performance Analysis Tools:

- There are a variety of performance analysis tools that can be used with threaded programs. Searching the web will turn up a wealth of information.
- At LC, the list of supported computing tools can be found at: [https://hpc.llnl.gov/software](https://hpc.llnl.gov/software).
- These tools vary significantly in their complexity, functionality and learning curve. Covering them in detail is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
- Some tools worth investigating, specifically for threaded codes, include:
    - Open\|SpeedShop
    - TAU
    - HPCToolkit
    - PAPI
    - Intel VTune Amplifier
    - ThreadSpotter
