### Routines:

[`pthread_join(thread, status)`](man/pthread_join.txt)

[`pthread_detach(thread)`](man/pthread_detach.txt)

[`pthread_attr_setdetachstate(attr, detachstate)`](man/pthread_attr_setdetachstate.txt)

[`pthread_attr_getdetachstate(attr)`](man/pthread_attr_getdetachstate.txt)

### Joining:

"Joining" is one way to accomplish synchronization between threads. For example:

![joining](images/joining.gif)

The `pthread_join()` subroutine blocks the calling thread until the specified `thread` terminates.

The programmer is able to obtain the target thread's termination `status` if it was specified in the target thread's call to `pthread_exit()`.

A joining thread can match one `pthread_join()` call. It is a logical error to attempt multiple joins on the same thread.

Two other synchronization methods, mutexes and condition variables, will be discussed later.

### Joinable or Not?

When a thread is created, one of its attributes defines whether it is joinable or detached. Only threads that are created as joinable can be joined. If a thread is created as detached, it can never be joined.

The final draft of the POSIX standard specifies that threads should be created as joinable.

To explicitly create a thread as joinable or detached, the `attr` argument in the `pthread_create()` routine is used. The typical 4-step process is:

* Declare a pthread attribute variable of the `pthread_attr_t` data type
* Initialize the attribute variable with `pthread_attr_init()`
* Set the attribute detached status with `pthread_attr_setdetachstate()`
* When done, free library resources used by the attribute with `pthread_attr_destroy()`

### Detaching

The `pthread_detach()` routine can be used to explicitly detach a thread even though it was created as joinable.

There is no converse routine.

### Recommendations:

If a thread requires joining, consider explicitly creating it as joinable. This provides portability as not all implementations may create threads as joinable by default.

If you know in advance that a thread will never need to join with another thread, consider creating it in a detached state. Some system resources may be able to be freed.

### Pthread Joining Example

```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

#define NUM_THREADS	4

void *BusyWork(void *t)
{
   int i;
   long tid;
   double result = 0.0;
   tid = (long)t;
   printf("Thread %ld starting...\n",tid);
   for (i=0; i<1000000; i++)
   {
      result = result + sin(i) * tan(i);
   }
   printf("Thread %ld done. Result = %e\n", tid, result);
   pthread_exit((void*) t);
}

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
   pthread_t thread[NUM_THREADS];
   pthread_attr_t attr;
   int rc;
   long t;
   void *status;

   /* Initialize and set thread detached attribute */
   pthread_attr_init(&attr);
   pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE);

   for(t = 0; t < NUM_THREADS; t++) {
      printf("Main: creating thread %ld\n", t);
      rc = pthread_create(&thread[t], &attr, BusyWork, (void *)t);
      if (rc) {
         printf("ERROR; return code from pthread_create() is %d\n", rc);
         exit(-1);
      }
   }

   /* Free attribute and wait for the other threads */
   pthread_attr_destroy(&attr);
   for(t=0; t<NUM_THREADS; t++) {
      rc = pthread_join(thread[t], &status);
      if (rc) {
         printf("ERROR; return code from pthread_join() is %d\n", rc);
         exit(-1);
      }
      printf("Main: completed join with thread %ld having a status
             of %ld\n",t,(long)status);
   }

   printf("Main: program completed. Exiting.\n");
   pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

See the source code [here](example_code/join.c).

Output:

```raw
